         <p>"David is a great admirer of the late Syd Barrett, as both a person of great inner beauty whom he feels privileged to have personally known, and as an extremely talented songwriter who could have been one of the world's greatest musical talents had circumstances been different. David always comments on the way the lyrics just seemed to pour from Syd, and he certainly inspired David."</p>
